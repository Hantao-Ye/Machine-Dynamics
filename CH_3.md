**Synthesis** and Analysis

_design or create a mechanism to give a certain motion_

## 1. Synthesis

### Qualitative Synthesis

the creation of potential solutions in the absence of a well-defined algorithm that configures or predicts the solution

### Type Synthesis

the definition of the proper type of mechanism best suited to the problem

### Dimensional Synthesis

the determination of the proportions (lengths) of the links necessary to
accomplish the desired motions

## 2. Function, Path and Motion Generation

### Function Generation

output motion is a defined mathematical function of the input motion

### Path Generation

output motion is a defined path along a set of $x\text{, }y$ points

### Motion Generation

output motion is a set of positions of a line defined as $x\text{, }y\text{, }\theta$ successive locations

## 3. Limiting Conditions

### Toggle

the toggle positions are determined by the collinearity of two moving links

- it will not allow further input motion in one direction from one of its rocker links
- a different link will then have to be driven to get it out of toggle

### Transmission Angle

the transmission angle is defined as the acute angle between the output link and the coupler

<div align = center><img src ="./assets/CH_3_Figure_2.png"></div>

- varies continuously
- a measure of the quality of force and velocity transmission at the joint
- the optimal value of the transmission angle is 90 degree
- most machine designer try to keep the minimum TA above 40 degree
- when TA is less than 45 degree, the radial component is larger than the tangential component

## 4. Dimensional Synthesis

### Dimensional Synthesis

a linkage is the determination of the proportions of the links necessary to accomplish the desired motions

### Two-Position Synthesis

**rocker output** (pure rotation) and **coupler output** (complex motion)
