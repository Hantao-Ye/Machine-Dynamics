## Introduction

A principle goal of **kinematics analysis** is to determine the **acceleration** of all the moving parts in the assembly

And the **stress** in materials must be kept well under its operating conditions

To calculate the **stress**, the first thing we need to know is the **accelerations**

In order to calculate the **accelerations**, we must find the **positions** of all the links or elements in the mechanism.
