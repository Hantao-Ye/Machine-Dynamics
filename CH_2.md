# CH_2

## Kinematic Chain

is an assembly of links connected by means of paris

- Locked Chain
- A Constrained Chain
- An Unconstrained Chain

## Mobility

the mobility is the numbers of freedom

### Gruebler's Equation

$$
    M=3(L-1)-2J_1-J_2
$$

Where:

- $M$: mobility
- $L$: number of links (**including ground**)
- $J_1$: number of 1 degree of freedom joints 
- $J_2$: number of 2 degrees of freedom joints
  

**where k links connect at a single joint, it must be counted as k-1 joints**

### Summary: Mobility

- $M > 1$: maybe an unconstrained mechanism
- $M = 1$: a constrained mechanism
- $M = 0$: a statically determinate structure
- $M < 0$: a statically indeterminate structure
