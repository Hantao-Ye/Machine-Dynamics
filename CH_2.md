# CH_2

## Kinematic Chain

is an assembly of links connected by means of paris

- Locked Chain
- A Constrained Chain
- An Unconstrained Chain

## Mobility

the mobility is the numbers of freedom

### Gruebler's Equation

<div align = center><img src = "https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?M%3D3%28L-1%29-2J_1-J_2"></div>

Where:

- *M* = mobility
- *L* = number of links (**including ground**)
- <img src = "https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cinline%20J_1"> = number of 1 degree of freedom joints 
- <img src = "https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cinline%20J_2"> = number of 2 degrees of freedom joints
  
**where k links connect at a single joint, it must be counted as k-1 joints**

### Summary: Mobility

- *M > 1*: maybe an unconstrained mechanism
- *M = 1*: a constrained mechanism
- *M = 0*: a statically determinate structure
- *M < 0*: a statically indeterminate structure
