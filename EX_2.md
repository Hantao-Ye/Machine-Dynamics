[TOC]

**Notation: the ground is always the first link in DOF questions**

## EX 2.1

an ordinary question on DOF of cam

<div align = center><img src = "./assets/EX_2_Figure_1.png"></div>

**Notation: the touch of the cam and the follower is a two freedom joint**

$L = 3$, $J_1 = 2$ and $J_2 = 1$

$DOF = 3(L-1)-2J_1-J_2 = 1$

## EX 2.2

an ordinary question on DOF of crank-slider

<div align = center><img src = "./assets/EX_2_Figure_2.png"></div>

**Notation: the touch between the slider block and the ground is a one freedom joint, and the slider block is also a link**

$L = 4$, $J_1 = 4$ and $J_2 = 0$

$DOF = 3(L-1)-2J_1-J_2 = 1$

## EX 2.3

an ordinary question on DOF of multiple joint and the sliding joint

<div align = center><img src = "./assets/EX_2_Figure_3.png"></div>

$L = 8$, $J_1 = 10$ and $J_2 = 0$

$DOF = 3(L-1)-2J_1-J_2 = 1$

## EX 2.4

an ordinary question on DOF of multiple joint and the joint on cam

<div align = center><img src = "./assets/EX_2_Figure_4.png"></div>

$L = 6$, $J_1 = 7$ and $J_2 = 1$

$DOF = 3(L-1)-2J_1-J_2 = 0$

> it's really hard to form a general model from the particular existences

## EX 2.5

tricky problem in the homework 1

8. Bell Crank
9. **Short Slider** (lies in the end of the bell crank)
10. Tooling (sliding on the ground)

**Full Joint**:

1. joint of $L_1$ and $L_2$
2. joint of $L_2$ and $L_3$
3. joint of $L_4$ and $L_1$
4. joint of $L_3$ and $L_4$ (the rotation is the pure rotation)

12. joint of $L_9$ and $L_{10}$
13. joint of $L_{10}$ and $L_1$

**Notation: if the rotation between the cam and other links is the pure rotation, then the joint between them is the full joint**
